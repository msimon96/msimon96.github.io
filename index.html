        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>

        <p class='background'>I’m currently Active Duty Army on my way out of the military after serving 7 years. I’m an aspiring 
            coder born and raised in Florida and also spent time in New Mexico growing up. Currently, attending 
            Western Governs University for my Bachelors in Network Operations and Security. I plan to obtain my 
            Masters in Business Administration. We all know the technical aspect of things but I think it’s key 
            to learn and integrate business concepts into that. I currently work as a Enterprise Incident Manager, 
            Systems Control Officer, Security Analyst, and Network Engineer. I recently started a consulting 
            business called Platinum IT Security to build a brand for myself with the goal of supporting small 
            communities, and the local and federal government with secure networks, applications, websites, and 
            more. At the moment the goal is to develop a solid foundation before taking on clientele to provide 
            the best service that I possible can.</p>
        
        <h2>HOBBIES</h2>
            <!-- paragraph with italic text -->
        <p>I like to binge watch movies and shows. Mostly, movies that are slightly older and shows that 
            have a twist in the plot. I like to read fictional books and those that are educational in 
            nature. Always learning something new is a lifelong goal of mine. “<em>Scientia Potentia Est
            </em>” or latent terms “Knowledge is Power”. Lately, I have been taking interest in ethical 
            hacking such as learning more about vulnerabilities, penetration testing via labs and real 
            world application with formal approval of course, and finding solutions to prevent others 
            from being victims of unethical hackers. Lastly, I’ve been trying to learn more about coding 
            and becoming an application and web developer. I’ve always had an interest in learning how 
            things work with an emphasis on applications. Why sit back and be the typical user when you 
            can be the developer who creates things that could last a lifetime.</p>
